# pjangler

Project subsystem bootstrapper CLI + MCP server.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## CLI usage

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js --help
# or if installed globally
pjangler --help
```

## Orienting in a repo

`describe` reads a repo and reports what it actually is — detected type,
installed subsystems, config files present, and what to do next. It is the
first call for an agent (or a human) landing somewhere unfamiliar, and it works
in any repo, 33GOD or not.

```bash
pjangler describe                # current directory
pjangler describe ../some-repo
pjangler describe --json         # machine-parseable, for agent context
pjangler describe --interactive  # tick off fixable findings, press A to apply
```

Subsystem presence and subsystem correctness are reported separately: presence
comes from marker files on disk, parity from the recipe's own audit rules. A
subsystem that was never installed reads `absent`, not `broken`.

### Last activity, not lifecycle status

Projects report **when work last happened**, not a lifecycle word. The old
`status` field said `planned` for 22 of 27 registered projects — including ones
with commits the same day — so it never varied and never informed.

Activity is computed from git at read time, so it cannot go stale and no cron
has to walk the registry. It spans more than the checked-out branch:

| source | covers |
| --- | --- |
| refs | every local branch, remote-tracking branch, and tag |
| worktrees | every linked worktree's HEAD, including detached ones whose commits are on no ref |
| uncommitted | working-tree edits that are not committed yet |

The newest of those wins, and the winning source is always reported. Remote
state reflects your last fetch — nothing here touches the network.

`pjangler project list` orders by that signal, newest work first.

## Shell prompt

`pjangler-prompt` prints one compact line when the working directory is inside a
pjangler project, and nothing at all when it is not:

```
pjangler (PJAN) · 3m
```

It is a separate binary from the main CLI on purpose — the CLI loads the whole
parity rule set and takes ~52ms to boot, while this runs in ~30ms, well inside
starship's 500ms budget.

Add it to `~/.config/starship.toml` as a second, project-scoped prompt line:

```toml
format = "…$all${custom.pjangler}$line_break$character"

[custom.pjangler]
description = "pjangler project context"
when = true
shell = ["sh"]
symbol = "◆"
style = "bold purple"
# The newline lives INSIDE the conditional group, so nothing is emitted —
# not even a blank line — outside a pjangler project.
format = "(\n[$symbol $output]($style))"
command = 'exec pjangler-prompt 2>/dev/null'
```

`$line_break` must be named explicitly: it is otherwise absorbed by `$all` and
the extra line lands in the wrong place.

## MCP server usage

Run over stdio:

```bash
npm run mcp
# or
pjangler-mcp
```
