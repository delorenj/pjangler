// Story 1.8 made `systemd` an observed domain in every scope, so a suite that
// seeds a fleet and asserts its agents are healthy now has to seed that fleet's
// SERVICE state too -- exactly as story 1.7 made every fixture profile
// renderer-clean. Without it the suites would either read this developer's own
// user manager (a fixture agent's units are not on it, so every agent would
// read `gateway-missing`) or read no manager at all (`manager-unavailable`, five
// `error` leaves per agent) and every "this agent is healthy" assertion would go
// red for a reason that has nothing to do with what it tests.
//
// The fake is installed on a case's PATH as `systemctl`, reads a JSON state
// file, appends every argv to an invocation log, and records the environment it
// was handed -- which is what lets a suite prove the observer's allowlist is the
// WHOLE environment a child receives and that no mutation verb was ever spawned.
