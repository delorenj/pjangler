// Machine and human output for `pjangler fleet ...`.
//
// A sibling of the notebook envelope rather than a reuse of it: the notebook
// envelope's `project` and `notebook` root blocks are mandatory and its command
// set is closed (`src/notebook/output.ts`). A fleet contract is not
// project-scoped, so borrowing that shape would either loosen the notebook's
// guarantees or force a fake project onto every fleet answer. The guarantees
// themselves -- bounded strings, capped details, ok <=> error === null, one
// complete document -- are reproduced here deliberately.
//
// ONE CONSTRAINT, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING: this module and `src/fleet/health.ts`
// import each other. This file needs `compareStatusFindings` and the two sort
// keys so the human report ranks findings exactly as the machine path does --
// two orderings would make the report's cap drop a different finding from the
// one the envelope drops. `health.ts` needs `bounded`/`redactHome` from here so
// a next action or a justification it builds is bounded on the same terms as
// every other string in the envelope. The cycle is deliberate, and it is SAFE
// ONLY BECAUSE NEITHER FILE CALLS THE OTHER AT MODULE SCOPE -- every use is
// inside a function body, so whichever half the bundler initializes second
// still has the first's bindings by the time anything runs.
//
// Do not add a top-level initializer to either file that calls across it. A
// `const X = compareStatusFindings(...)` here, or a `const Y = bounded(...)`
// there, is a `TypeError: ... is not a function` at import time in whichever
// order the bundle happens to emit -- and every suite runs the BUNDLE, so it
// would surface as the whole CLI failing to start rather than as a unit-test
// failure pointing at the line.
