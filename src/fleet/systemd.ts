// Read-only systemd topology and service health: every registered agent's
// canonical unit set derived from the contract, sampled off the user manager
// over a declared stabilization window, and proven against the DESIRED state
// the registry's own messaging declaration derives.
//
// Before this, `systemd` reported every agent `unsupported` (the `unit_topology`
// deferral): unit names were expectations `service_model.per_agent` derives,
// never observations. On the live fleet that hid real drift -- a gateway
// enabled+active for an agent whose row declares its channels deferred, a
// verified-Telegram agent whose gateway is disabled, a heartbeat oneshot whose
// latest result is an exit code, a deferred agent whose empty delta inherits
// the fleet base's platform enablement, heartbeat pairs on disk the registry
// never recorded, a registered agent with no units at all, a retired consumer
// reference, and a set of unregistered `hermes-*` units nothing reported.
//
// Seven disciplines:
//
//   * READ-ONLY, AND STRUCTURALLY SO. The only `systemctl --user` verbs this
//     module can spawn are the four in `SYSTEMD_READ_VERBS`. There is no code
//     path to `enable`, `start`, `daemon-reload` or `reset-failed`, no write
//     anywhere under the unit directory, and every child receives an
//     ALLOWLISTED environment (the manifest's `probe.env_allowlist` plus the
//     four pager/locale pins) rather than a filtered copy of this process's.
//   * SAMPLE THE MANAGER, NOT THE AGENTS. One `show` carries every unit of
//     interest, so a window is `stabilization.samples` children regardless of
//     fleet size -- and every agent's window is the SAME window, which is what
//     makes "stable over the window" a fleet-wide claim rather than 84
//     unrelated ones. A failed manager probe skips sampling entirely.
//   * DESIRED STATE COMES FROM THE DECLARATION, NOT FROM THE UNIT. The
//     provisioner enables a gateway only when a platform's `provisioning_status`
//     is `verified`, and disables it otherwise. Reading that declaration back
//     off the registry makes "deferred but enabled" and "verified but disabled"
//     visible as drift instead of two alternate healthy modes, and makes a row
//     that declares nothing `undeclared` -- an active gateway there is the
//     liveness theatre the epic forbids, never health.
//   * THE TEMPLATE'S STABILITY RULE IS THE CONTRACT. `_lib.sh`'s
//     `systemd_wait_for_stable_health` rejects any window in which a unit looked
//     healthy and then changed, and `systemd_timer_health_snapshot` refuses a
//     oneshot that has not completed (systemd pre-initialises `Result=success`
//     before the first exit). Both are encoded here, so a deploy's "stabilized"
//     claim and this reading can never disagree about what stable means.
//   * BUCKETS, NEVER AGES. No timestamp, age, pid, duration or completion order
//     reaches `data`. Monotonic properties are compared against
//     `process.hrtime.bigint()` -- CLOCK_MONOTONIC, the same clock systemd's
//     `*USecMonotonic` properties use -- and reduced to `current | overdue |
//     never | unknown` and `success | failed | in-progress | stuck | never |
//     unknown`. Two runs over unchanged state produce identical bytes; a tick
//     between them is a real change.
//   * UNREGISTERED UNITS ARE FINDINGS, NEVER A LICENCE. Every `hermes-*` unit no
//     registered row claims lands in exactly one of five classes with bounded
//     evidence and guidance, and is left alone. None is assigned to the nearest
//     agent name, and every one carries `process_reference: "unobserved"` --
//     attributing the process behind a unit is story 1.9.
//   * BOUNDED AND NARROW. From `Environment=` only the two declared keys; from
//     `ExecStart=` only `path=` and the first argv token; from a transient
//     scope's `Description=` only an exact `--profile <name>` token naming a
//     REGISTERED profile. Nothing else from those properties reaches `data`,
//     notes, items or diagnostics, and every path goes through `shown`.
//
// This module never constructs a `FleetStatusObservation`. It returns typed
// per-agent aspect results, a manager record, a shared-gateway record, an
// unregistered classification and probe records; `status.ts` turns them into
// observations through its single construction point.
