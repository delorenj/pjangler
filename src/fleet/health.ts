// Whether a fleet answer is TRUSTWORTHY, and what to do about it.
//
// Story 1.4 reports what every domain observed. It cannot say whether the
// answer can be believed: `health.healthy` is `fail === 0 && error === 0`, so a
// default run over a fleet where three of nine domains have no observer at all
// and every audit-fed domain is `unobserved` still reports `healthy: true`.
// That is precisely what the epic forbids -- an aggregate may never claim
// healthy when a required domain was skipped, truncated, stale, or unobserved.
//
// This module is the evaluator that makes it impossible, and it is a separate
// file on purpose: a truth table wants its own suite, and folding it into a
// 1600-line `status.ts` is how it becomes untestable.
//
// Five disciplines:
//
//   * FOUR AXES, NOT ONE WORD. `state` says what was concluded.
//     `applicability` says whether it was required. `evidence` says how
//     strongly. `freshness` says whether it is still current. Collapsing any
//     two of them is how "we did not look" becomes "it is fine".
//   * ONLY THE CONTRACT CAN JUSTIFY A GAP. A skip, a warning, a deferred
//     capability or a managed exception is authorized only by a
//     `health_policy` entry, and the entry is NAMED on the observation it
//     authorizes. Nothing is inferred, and a contract with no policy block
//     justifies nothing -- which makes `proven` false rather than making the
//     run fail.
//   * SEVERITY, REPAIR AND THE NEXT ACTION COME FROM REAL FIELDS. `fixable`,
//     `rule_scope`, and the contract's own `activation.execution_authority` --
//     never from prose, and never from a keyword scan of a summary.
//   * FRESHNESS IS A BUCKET, NEVER AN AGE. `data` has to be byte-identical
//     across two consecutive runs, and an age in seconds is not. The reference
//     instant is captured once per run by the caller and is never serialized.
//   * A RECOMMENDED COMMAND IS READ-ONLY UNLESS IT IS LABELLED. A
//     `requires-authorization` action must name the authorization in the string
//     itself; this module refuses to emit one that does not.
//
// ONE CONSTRAINT, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING: this module and `src/fleet/output.ts`
// import each other. `output.ts` needs `compareStatusFindings` and the two sort
// keys so the human report ranks findings exactly as the machine path does, and
// this file needs `bounded`/`redactHome` from there so a next action or a
// justification it builds is bounded on the same terms as every other string in
// the envelope. The cycle is deliberate and it
// is SAFE ONLY BECAUSE NEITHER FILE CALLS THE OTHER AT MODULE SCOPE -- every
// use is inside a function body, so whichever half the bundler initializes
// second still has the first's bindings by the time anything runs.
//
// Do not add a top-level initializer to either file that calls across it. A
// `const X = bounded(...)` here, or a `const Y = compareStatusFindings(...)`
// there, is a `TypeError: ... is not a function` at import time in whichever
// order the bundle happens to emit -- and every suite runs the BUNDLE, so it
// would surface as the whole CLI failing to start rather than as a unit-test
// failure pointing at the line.
