// Registry-wide, strictly read-only fleet inventory.
//
// The question this module answers is the one nothing in the repo could answer
// before it: "what is the whole fleet, and where does it disagree with itself?"
//
// Three disciplines make that answerable rather than merely printable:
//
//   * TOLERANT PARSING. `loadProjectRegistry` throws on exactly the duplicates
//     this command exists to REPORT (slug, repo_path, board_id, identifier),
//     and `readHermesAgentBoards` throws raw ENOENT on a missing file. Neither
//     can be reused. Both stores are parsed here with per-record salvage, so one
//     bad row is one finding rather than a run that produced nothing.
//   * INDEPENDENT COUNTING. `totals.source_rows` is counted from the raw
//     `agents:` mapping keys in its own pass before any row is built, so a bug
//     in the row builder shows up as `source_rows != emitted_rows` rather than
//     as an agent that quietly vanished.
//   * DECLARED PROVENANCE. Every emitted value carries the authority `owner`
//     the CONTRACT declares for its field path. Nothing here invents an owner;
//     a field path the contract does not cover reports `source: null` and says
//     so in a finding.
//
// Read-only is not a convention here, it is the contract: no registry, manifest,
// profile, repo, service, or network write, and no directory, project, role,
// profile, or registry row is ever created. Paths are classified with `lstat`
// and never followed for mutation -- a symlink is reported as a symlink with its
// target as evidence, never silently retargeted.
//
// What this module deliberately does NOT do: probe systemd, probe a process,
// probe Bloodbank, or reach the network. Expected unit names are expectations
// (state `unobserved`); the Bloodbank block is the STORED routing record. Those
// observations are stories 1.3-1.10.
