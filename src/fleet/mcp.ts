// The MCP half of the fleet observation surface.
//
// It lives here rather than in `src/mcp-server.ts` for one reason: the story's
// hard claim is that CLI and MCP are two THIN adapters over one core, adding
// envelope wrapping and `next_actions` guidance and nothing else -- no extra
// option, no different default, no alternate policy. That claim is only worth
// making if it is inspectable, and a reviewer can read this file end to end in a
// minute and see that every handler does exactly three things: shape arguments,
// call the shared core, wrap the result.
//
// `asText` is passed IN rather than imported. `src/mcp-server.ts` runs
// `await server.connect(new StdioServerTransport())` at module scope, so
// importing anything from it would start a server as a side effect of loading
// this module. Cloning the helper instead would give the tool surface two result
// shapes, which is the thing the shared helper exists to prevent.
