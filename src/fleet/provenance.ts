// Registry-wide, strictly read-only fleet PROVENANCE.
//
// Story 1.2 answers "what is the fleet"; this answers "which build is each
// agent actually running?" -- the question the live fleet fails today. 21 of 28
// agents point `hermes.bin` at a legacy `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` checkout whose
// origin is NousResearch/hermes-agent, while the configured pin is
// delorenj/hermes-agent at a different SHA; 13 declare a `hermes.repo` that does
// not exist; 21 carry no `hermes.git_sha` at all.
//
// ONE GLOBAL RULE, and everything else follows from it:
//
//   `desired` is the RECORDED / PINNED / DECLARED side.
//   `observed` is the LIVE side.
//
// That is what makes the template-gitlink fact structural rather than
// defensive. The recorded gitlink is read from `git ls-files --stage` on the
// PARENT repository and lands in `desired`, so no amount of worktree movement,
// local rendering, or test activity can move it; `observed` is the submodule's
// own HEAD. A reader never has to ask which side is authoritative.
//
// Four disciplines make the answer trustworthy rather than merely printable:
//
//   * ABSENCE IS NEVER A MATCH. `missing`, `unsupported` and `unobserved` are
//     distinct from `match` in the fact, in `totals.by_status`, and in `health`.
//     A failed probe downgrades its own fact and leaves every other agent and
//     domain intact.
//   * NOTHING IS EXECUTED THAT IS BEING OBSERVED. The observed `hermes` binary
//     is classified by PATH against the contract's retired `detect` patterns and
//     the configured release root. It is never run, and nothing here fetches,
//     pulls, clones, or touches the network.
//   * NOTHING IS WRITTEN. Every git probe passes `--no-optional-locks` (a plain
//     `git status` refreshes `.git/index`, which the suite's content+mtime
//     snapshot catches as a write) and the only subcommands used are
//     `ls-files`, `rev-parse`, `remote get-url` and `status --porcelain`.
//   * CREDENTIALS ARE EXCLUDED BY CONSTRUCTION. `~/.hermes/fleet.env` carries
//     two live Plane API keys. It is read only through `readShellAssignments`
//     with a key allowlist, so an unlisted key never enters memory -- there is
//     no redaction pass here that can be forgotten. Probes parse stdout into one
//     value and discard the rest; stderr is never read at all.
//
// `data` is DETERMINISTIC: no timestamp, duration, hostname, or ordering by
// completion. Two runs over identical state produce byte-identical `data`, which
// is what turns the CLI/MCP parity assertion into an equality rather than a
// resemblance.
//
// What this module deliberately does NOT do: probe systemd, live processes, or
// Bloodbank (stories 1.8/1.9/1.10); compare scaffold or profile CONTENT against
// the template (stories 1.6/1.7); or repair, adopt, retire, or plan anything.
